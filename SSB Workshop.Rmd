Workshop Description
Phylogenies form the foundation of our understanding of both the pattern and process of evolution on Earth.  Methods for inferring phylogenies and using them in comparative and macroevolutionary analyses are constantly improving, and it can prove difficult for even seasoned investigators in the field to keep pace.  In this workshop we will offer a collection of short (approximately one hour per topic) courses on a diverse array of new analytical methods.  

This workshop will be suitable for graduate students, postdocs, and senior faculty.  It is intended for users who are already familiar with R and have a good working knowledge of phylogenetics.  Attendees will be expected to bring a laptop with R and RStudio installed, and will be provided with a list of necessary R packages beforehand.
